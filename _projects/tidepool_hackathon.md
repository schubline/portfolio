caption: Using a limited number of observations taken from the blood glucose meters of insulin dependent diabetics, built, tested and assessed the effectiveness of a supervised classification model to predict whether to patient is type one or type two diabetic.

description: |

  In this Hackathon, each team was asked to build a single classification model, of a randomly assigned type, to try to predict the classes,type 1, type 2 diabetes. We had to work within the contraints and best practices of our model type (Logistic Regression) for the duration of this hackathon. The goal was to build, test and quantify the utility of your given model. Once a basic model is built, we looked at how we could  best tune the parameters, tweak the data, engineer variables to improve the predictive utility.
