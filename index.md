Hello, welcome to my portfolio/blog-ish thingy! I'm Schubert, sometimes called Schuby, Schubes and Schubuntu ever since I switched to Linux. I live at the intersection of data, social science and the internet. On this site you'll find a collection of data science projects I've worked on, a few blog posts and an abridged version of my resume. Click away! :)

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect, I'm always looking for new opportunities and feedback!
